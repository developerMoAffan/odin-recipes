    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lebanese Chicken Shawarma is a classic Middle Eastern street food
      favorite, celebrated for its juicy, spiced meat and bold, savory flavors.
      Thinly sliced chicken is marinated in a mix of aromatic spices like cumin,
      paprika, turmeric, and garlic, combined with a hint of tangy yogurt and
      lemon juice to tenderize the meat. Traditionally cooked on a vertical
      rotisserie, the meat is shaved off as it crisps, but at home, it's often
      pan-seared or grilled to perfection. Served wrapped in soft pita or
      flatbread, it's usually paired with creamy garlic sauce (toum), fresh
      veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles, and sometimes a drizzle of
      tahini. Shawarma is more than just a wrap — it's a fusion of smoky, tangy,
      and savory flavors all rolled into one satisfying, handheld meal.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the marinade: Combine malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt, vegetable
        oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt, and pepper together in a glass baking
        dish. Add chicken thighs to the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and
        marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To make the tahini sauce: Combine tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, lemon
        juice, olive oil, and parsley together in a small bowl. Season with salt
        and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once.
        Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is
        browned and cooked through. Remove chicken from the dish, and cut into
        slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads. Roll
        up, and top with tahini sauce.
