    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fried Chicken is a timeless comfort food classic, loved for its golden,
      crunchy crust and juicy, tender meat inside. Prepared by coating chicken
      pieces in a seasoned flour or batter mix, the chicken is deep-fried until
      perfectly crisp on the outside while staying flavorful and moist on the
      inside. The secret to great fried chicken lies in the balance of spices —
      usually a mix of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and sometimes a
      touch of herbs — and the contrast between the crispy coating and succulent
      meat. Whether served with fries, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or simply
      enjoyed on its own, fried chicken is a universally satisfying meal that’s
      perfect for any occasion. From street stalls to fancy diners, this dish is
      a crispy celebration of bold, simple flavors that never goes out of style.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 3 cups
        flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning
        together in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and
        1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if
        batter is too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour
        mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the
        seasoned flour mixture once more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until
        crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
