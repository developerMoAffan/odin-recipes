    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani is a world-famous aromatic rice dish that
      originated from the royal kitchens of Hyderabad, India. Known for its rich
      flavors and mouthwatering aroma, this biryani combines long-grain basmati
      rice, tender marinated chicken, and a blend of bold spices like saffron,
      cardamom, and cinnamon. The magic lies in the “Dum” cooking method — where
      marinated chicken and partially cooked rice are layered, sealed, and
      slow-cooked together, allowing the flavors to infuse deeply. The result is
      a perfect balance of spiced meat and fluffy, fragrant rice, often served
      with raita, salan (gravy), or a side of salad. A perfect feast for
      festivals, family gatherings, or whenever you want to treat yourself to an
      authentic Indian culinary experience!

    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
      <li>20 whole cloves</li>
      <li>9 whole cardamom pods</li>
      <li>5 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>5 small green chile peppers</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ginger garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>6 fresh curry leaves (Optional)</li>
      <li>3 cups uncooked jasmine or white rice</li>
      <li>4 ⅛ cups water</li>
      <li>1 sprig cilantro leaves with stems</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak rice for 30 minutes in enough water to cover; then drain.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
        cloves, cardamom, and bay leaves. Then stir in onion, and cook until
        soft, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in chile peppers and ginger paste. Stir in
        yogurt, salt, and curry, and then place chicken in pan. Cook for 20 to
        25 minutes, stirring occasionally and turning the chicken pieces, until
        only about 1 cup of liquid remains.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in rice, water, and cilantro. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low,
        cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Check rice after about 12 minutes; if it
        is dry, add 1/2 cup water, and continue cooking.
